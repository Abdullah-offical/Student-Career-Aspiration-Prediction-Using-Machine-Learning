Student Career Aspiration Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict students' career aspirations based on academic and extracurricular data. Using a RandomForestClassifier, the model classifies students into various career categories, aiding in career planning and educational guidance.

Key Features
- Data Processing:** Preprocesses academic and extracurricular features.
- Model Training:** Utilizes a RandomForestClassifier for training on the dataset.
- Evaluation:** Assesses model performance with accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
- Prediction:** Predicts career aspirations based on input features.

Implementation
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing**
2. Feature Selection and Scaling**
3. Model Training and Evaluation**
4. Prediction and Recommendations**

Results
Achieves 85% accuracy in predicting career aspirations, providing valuable insights for educators and students.

Future Work
- Enhance model accuracy with additional features and algorithms.
- Develop a web interface for user-friendly predictions.
